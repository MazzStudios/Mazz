### FAQ

Below is a list of questions being frequently asked to us. You'll probably find your answer here.

  

#### How do I make a suggestion?

Depends on the type of suggestion. The best is if you could code the actual suggestion and propose a commit on this Github. It's okay if you don't know how to code. We can. Here is a list with the type of suggestions and where to suggest them:

<li><u>Bugs</u></li>

Not really a suggestion, but worth mentioning. Bugs can be reported in the <a  href="https://github.com/RyanLandDev/Mazz/issues">Issues</a> tab. Make sure the bug you've found hasn't been reported before. You can check this using the search bar in the tab.

<li><u>Feature requests</u></li>

New features can be requested in multiple ways. If you want people to be able to vote for your idea, we recommend you to suggest it in our <a  href="https://discord.gg/aZEZ7Ct">support server</a>. If it is a balance change or any other feature request, you should create a <a  href="https://github.com/RyanLandDev/Mazz/issues/new">new issue</a>.

<li><u>Other</u></li>

Any other type of suggestion should probably be submitted to, once again, the <a  href="https://github.com/RyanLandDev/Mazz/issues">Issues</a> tab. If you're not sure, you can message a staff member in our <a  href="https://discord.gg/aZEZ7Ct">support server</a>.

  

#### I want to help code the bot. How can I?

The best way to get into the Mazz developer team is to create pull requests. Fixing bugs in the code, creating planned features, and so on. If we see you are requesting a lot of good pulls (and we accept them) that means you are doing a good job! If we want you to join the official team, we'll shoot you a DM.

### What should I help with?

You could help with anything! Helping us in any way helps. What helps us most? üêû <b>Bug fixes</b>. We love to work on new features, but unfortunately bugs come with that too. It would make our day if you helped fix one of them!
